# Uninstall existing copy of Sophos 9.x by checking for the InstallationDeployer application
# in the following locations:
#
# Sophos AV Home Edition
# /Library/Application Support/Sophos/he/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS
# /Library/Application Support/Sophos/he/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/tools
#
# Sophos AV Standalone
# /Library/Application Support/Sophos/opm-sa/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS
# /Library/Application Support/Sophos/opm-sa/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/tools
#
# Sophos AV Enterprise
# /Library/Application Support/Sophos/opm/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS
# /Library/Application Support/Sophos/opm/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/tools
#
# If the InstallationDeployer application is present in the Contents/MacOS/tools directory, the
# uninstallation process is run using the InstallationDeployer tool located there.
#
# If the InstallationDeployer application is present only in the Contents/MacOS directory, the
# uninstallation process is run using the InstallationDeployer tool located there.
#
# The reason for the directory-specific check is that running the InstallationDeployer application
# from Contents/MacOS on Sophos 9.1.x and later will cause the Sophos uninstaller application to
# launch in the dock and interfere with a normal installation via installer package.
